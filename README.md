# Streams-Calculator
- Write a program sum.cpp that reads a sequence of integers from cin, and reports their sum.

- We want to make a simple calculator that can add and subtract integers, and will accept arbitrarily long mathematical formulas composed of symbols +, -, and non-negative integer numbers.

- Write a better version of the calculator, calc2.cpp, that can evaluate multiple arithmetic expressions. Let’s use the semicolon symbol that must be used at the end of each expression in the input.

- Write an even better calculator program calc3.cpp that can understand squared numbers. We are going to use a simplified notation X^ to mean X2. For example, 10^ + 7 - 51^ should mean 102 + 7 − 512.
